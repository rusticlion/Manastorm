## Purpose
This is a hybrid to-do list and bluesky whiteboard, organized by task type.

## Visualization/Gamefeel
### Tie Mana Pool orbits to mana token type
* MOON moves in sine wave shaped orbit, FIRE moves in ellipse, etc.

### Better visual language for spell slots and cast progress
* ?? on whole thing...current vibes are serviceable
* DONE - Experiment with no explicitly drawn static orbit, only draw as cast bar
* Experiment with transparent lines or particles flowing between mana tokens in slot. Strengthen with cast progress?

### Unique "idle" animations for each stance
* DONE - Stretch: unique "cast" animations for each stance
  
### Tween frames for range/position changes
* DONE
### Establish visual language for Ninefold Path
* Two colors per element, "core" and "aura"?

### FX on taking damage
* DONE - Hitstop - exclude DoT (burn, etc. Minimum threshold?)
  * Implementation scales with DMG value - consistent rule that makes DoTs feel right.
* Flashing effect for DoT (for everything maybe?)
  * DONE, for everything

### Consistent-fy visual language for shield types: ward vs. barrier
* Barrier is a partly-transparent "screen" that extends up and down from the spell slot
* Ward is a set of floating runes that orbits in-line wit the spell slot

### SFX
* Whole thing needs to be built
* Stubbed alongside VFX, should be similar and a bit simpler
* handle overlapping sounds somehow

## Rules Engine
### Update mana types to canonical Ninefold Path
  * DONE
* Material: FIRE, WATER, SALT
* Celestial: SUN, MOON, STAR
* Transcendental: SOURCE, MIND, VOID
* Update all spells to use definitions

### Unify Shield spells with new "Trap" type/keyword set under a "sustained spell" umbrella
* DONE

### Support "Field" spell type/keyword as an additional type of ongoing effect/"sustained spell"

### Better consistent rules for Burn stacking rather than quasi-overlapping shared timer thing. Use in Brightwulf design.
