# SFX Gating Implementation

## Overview
The SFX gating system prevents crashes when sound files are missing or corrupted during development. All sound-related operations are now conditional based on an `ENABLE_SFX` configuration flag.

## Changes Made

### 1. Settings Module (`core/Settings.lua`)
- Added `ENABLE_SFX = false` to the defaults configuration
- This disables SFX by default during development

### 2. VFX Module (`vfx.lua`)
- Added Settings import
- Added `VFX.isSFXEnabled()` helper function
- Modified sound loading to check `ENABLE_SFX` before attempting to load sounds
- Added error handling with `pcall` for sound loading
- Modified sound playing to check `ENABLE_SFX` before playing
- Added documentation comments

### 3. AssetCache Module (`core/AssetCache.lua`)
- Added Settings import
- Modified `getSound()` function to check `ENABLE_SFX` before loading
- Modified `preload()` function to skip sound loading when SFX is disabled
- Added appropriate logging messages

### 4. Main Module (`main.lua`)
- Modified sound play operation in slot highlighting to check `ENABLE_SFX`

## How to Enable SFX

### Method 1: Edit settings.lua
```lua
return {
    dummyFlag = false,
    gameSpeed = "FAST",
    ENABLE_SFX = true,  -- Enable SFX
    controls = {
        -- ... rest of settings
    }
}
```

### Method 2: Programmatically
```lua
local Settings = require("core.Settings")
Settings.set("ENABLE_SFX", true)
```

### Method 3: Check SFX Status
```lua
local VFX = require("vfx")
if VFX.isSFXEnabled() then
    -- SFX is enabled
else
    -- SFX is disabled
end
```

## Benefits

1. **Crash Prevention**: Game won't crash when sound files are missing
2. **Development Friendly**: Can develop without sound assets
3. **Configurable**: Easy to enable/disable via settings
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Visual effects work without sound
5. **Error Handling**: Proper error messages when sound loading fails

## Testing

The system has been tested to ensure:
- Game starts without crashes when SFX is disabled
- Sound loading is properly gated
- Sound playing is properly gated
- Settings can be changed at runtime
- Error handling works correctly

## Future Considerations

- When actual sound assets are created, set `ENABLE_SFX = true` in production
- Consider adding individual sound enable/disable flags for fine-grained control
- May want to add volume controls when SFX is enabled
