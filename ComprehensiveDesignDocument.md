Game Title: Manastorm (working title)

Genre: Tactical Wizard Dueling / Real-Time Strategic Battler

Target Platforms: PC (initial), with possible future expansion to consoles

Core Pitch:

A high-stakes, low-input real-time dueling game where two spellcasters 
clash in arcane combat by channeling mana from a shared pool to queue 
spells into orbiting "spell slots." Strategy emerges from a shared 
resource economy, strict limitations on casting tempo, and deep 
interactions between positional states and spell types. Think Street 
Fighter meets Magic: The Gathering, filtered through an occult operating 
system.

Core Gameplay Loop:

Spell Selection Phase (Pre-battle)

Each player drafts a small set of spells from a shared pool.

These spells define their available actions for the match.

OR

Character Select Phase (Pre-battle)

Each player selects a character with a unique spellbook from a fighting-game style roster.

Combat Phase (Real-Time)

Players queue spells from their loadout (max 3 at a time).

Each spell channels mana from a shared pool and takes time to resolve.

Spells resolve in real-time after a fixed cast duration.

Cast spells release mana back into the shared pool, ramping intensity.

Positioning states (NEAR/FAR, GROUNDED/AERIAL) alter spell legality and 
effects.

Players win by reducing the opponent’s health to zero.

Key Systems & Concepts:

1. Spell Queue & Spell Slots

Each player has 3 spell slots.

Spells are queued into slots using hotkeys (Q/W/E or similar).

Each slot is visually represented as an orbit ring around the player 
character.

Channeled mana tokens orbit in these rings.

2. Mana Pool System

A shared pool of mana tokens floats in the center of the screen.

Tokens are temporarily removed when used to queue a spell.

Upon spell resolution, tokens return to the pool.

Tokens have types (e.g. FIRE, VOID, WATER), which interact with spell 
costs and effects.

The mana pool escalates tension by becoming more dynamic and volatile as 
spells resolve.

3. Token States

FREE: Available in the pool.

CHANNELED: Orbiting a caster while a spell is charging.

LOCKED: Temporarily unavailable due to enemy effects.

DESTROYED: Rare, removed from match entirely.

4. Positional States

Each player exists in binary positioning states:

Range: NEAR / FAR

Elevation: GROUNDED / AERIAL

Many spells can only be cast or take effect under certain conditions.

Players can be moved between states via spell effects.

5. Cast Feedback (Diegetic UI)

Each spell slot shows its cast time progression via a glowing arc rotating 
around the orbit.

Players can visually read how close a spell is to resolving.

No abstract bars; all feedback is embedded in the arena.

6. Spellbook System

Players have access to a limited loadout of spells during combat.

A separate spellbook UI (toggleable) shows full names, descriptions, and 
mechanics.

Core battlefield UI remains minimal to prioritize visual clarity and 
strategic deduction.

Visual & Presentation Goals

Combat is side-view, 2D.

Wizards are expressive but minimal sprites.

Mana tokens are vibrant, animated symbols.

All key mechanics are visible in-world (tokens, cast arcs, positioning 
shifts).

No HUD overload; world itself communicates state.

Design Pillars

Tactical Clarity: All decisions have observable consequences.

Strategic Literacy: Experienced players gain advantage by reading visual 
patterns.

Diegetic Information: The battlefield tells the story; minimal overlays.

Shared Economy, Shared Risk: Players operate in a closed loop that fuels 
both offense and defense.

Example Spells (Shortlist)

Ashgar the Emberfist:

Firebolt: Quick ranged hit, more damage at FAR.

Meteor Dive: Aerial finisher, hits GROUNDED enemies.

Combust Lock: Locks opponent mana token, punishes overqueueing.

Selene of the Veil:

Mist Veil: Projectile block, grants AERIAL.

Gravity Pin: Traps AERIAL enemies.

Eclipse Echo: Delays central queued spell.

Target Experience

Matches last 2–5 minutes.

Constant mental engagement without twitchy inputs.

Read-your-opponent mind games and counterplay at the forefront.

Replayable duels with high skill ceiling and unique matchups.

This document will evolve, but this version represents the intended 
holistic vision of the gameplay experience, tone, and structure of 
Manastorm.
