# Ticket PROG-15: Visual Distinction for Shield Slots

## Goal
Improve UI clarity by visually distinguishing active shield slots from regular spell slots.

## Tasks

1. Update drawSpellSlots to show active shields differently.

2. Implement visual indicators for active shield slots, such as:
   - Different border color or glow
   - Shield icon or overlay
   - Distinct background color or pattern

3. Ensure the visual distinction scales appropriately with the UI and is visible at different game resolutions.

## Acceptance Criteria
Active shield slots are visually distinct from regular spell slots in a way that clearly communicates their status to the player.
