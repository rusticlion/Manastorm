# Ticket #3-5: Event List Execution Refactor - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This ticket implements a major architectural shift in how spell effects are applied to the game state. Previously, the `compiledSpell.executeAll()` method directly mutated wizard and token states in memory. The new system generates a structured series of events that are then processed by a dedicated `EventRunner` which cleanly applies the state changes.

## Files Created/Modified

**New Files:**
- `docs/combat_events.md` - Comprehensive event schema definition
- `systems/EventRunner.lua` - Core event processing system
- `tools/test_eventRunner.lua` - Unit tests for EventRunner
- `tools/test_spellEvents.lua` - Tests for spell event generation
- `tools/compare_event_systems.lua` - Legacy vs. event system comparison
- `tools/system_test_event_integration.lua` - End-to-end integration test
- `patches/wizard_castSpell_event_integration.patch` - Patch for wizard.lua

**Modified Files:**
- `spellCompiler.lua` - Updated to generate events instead of mutating state
- `Tickets/3-5-implementation-summary.md` - This implementation summary

## Key Changes

1. **Event Schema Definition**
   - Created a comprehensive event schema in `docs/combat_events.md`
   - Defined standard event structure with type, source, and target fields
   - Documented 15+ event types covering all existing keyword behaviors

2. **EventRunner Implementation**
   - Created `systems/EventRunner.lua` to process events and apply state changes
   - Implemented priority-based event processing for consistent execution order
   - Added handlers for all event types (damage, status, elevation, etc.)
   - Built backward compatibility conversion from old results format

3. **Spell Compiler Updates**
   - Modified `SpellCompiler.lua` to generate events rather than mutate state directly
   - Added a toggle system to switch between legacy and event-based execution
   - Preserved backward compatibility while enabling the new functionality
   - Added debug options for tracing event generation and processing

4. **Testing and Validation**
   - Created test scripts to validate the new event system
   - Implemented side-by-side comparison of legacy vs. event-based execution
   - Added comprehensive unit tests for event generation and processing

## Implementation Details

### Event System Architecture

The new event system follows this execution flow:

1. Spell's `executeAll()` executes keyword behaviors to collect state changes
2. Changes are converted to structured events with standardized fields
3. Events are sorted by priority to ensure consistent execution order
4. `EventRunner.processEvents()` applies each event to the game state
5. Results are collected and returned for UI/VFX updates

### Execution Priority

Events are processed in a carefully designed order to ensure consistency:

1. State-setting events (elevation, range)
2. Resource events (token creation, destruction)
3. Spell timeline events (delay, accelerate, cancel)
4. Defense events (shields, reflects)
5. Status effect events
6. Damage events
7. Special effect events

### Backward Compatibility

The implementation maintains full backward compatibility through:

1. A dual-path system that can use either legacy or event-based execution
2. Automatic conversion of legacy results to events
3. Preservation of the existing results table structure

## Benefits

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Event description (what happens) is separated from state mutation (how it happens)
2. **Testability**: Event sequences can be stored, replayed, and validated
3. **Debugging**: Events provide a clear trace of what happened during a spell
4. **Side Effect Isolation**: All state modifications happen in one place (EventRunner)
5. **Future Extensibility**: New features like replay, network sync, and AI analysis are now possible

## Usage Instructions

### Enabling Event-Based Execution

```lua
-- Enable event-based execution (on by default)
SpellCompiler.setUseEventSystem(true)

-- Enable event debug output
SpellCompiler.setDebugEvents(true)
```

### Accessing Events

When using the event system, spell execution results include the generated events:

```lua
local results = compiledSpell.executeAll(caster, target, {}, spellSlot)
for _, event in ipairs(results.events) do
    print(event.type, event.target) -- Access event details
end
```

### Testing Tools

Several test scripts were created to validate the event system:

- `tools/test_eventRunner.lua`: Unit tests for the EventRunner module
- `tools/test_spellEvents.lua`: Tests event generation for various spell types
- `tools/compare_event_systems.lua`: Side-by-side comparison of execution modes

## Future Work

1. **Event Logging**: Add persistent logging of events for debugging and analytics
2. **Network Synchronization**: Use events as the basis for multiplayer state sync
3. **Deterministic Replay**: Save event streams to perfectly recreate matches
4. **AI Integration**: Use event prediction for AI decision-making

## Conclusion

The Event List Execution Refactor establishes a solid foundation for future game features while maintaining backward compatibility. By cleanly separating state description from mutation, the system is now more robust, testable, and extensible.
