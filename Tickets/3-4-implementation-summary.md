# Ticket 3-4 Implementation Summary

## Tasks Completed

1. **Core Pool Module**:
   - Created `core/Pool.lua` with `acquire()` and `release()` functions
   - Added pool statistics tracking and debugging tools
   - Implemented object reuse with customizable factory and reset functions
   - Added automatic pool growth for high-demand scenarios
   - Created comprehensive visual debug overlay

2. **Mana Token Pooling**:
   - Refactored `manapool.lua` to use Pool.acquire("token") instead of direct table creation
   - Implemented token reset function to safely clear all token properties
   - Modified token destruction code to release tokens back to the pool
   - Pre-allocated a pool of 50 tokens for smooth gameplay

3. **VFX Particle Pooling**:
   - Refactored `vfx.lua` to use pools for both effects and particles
   - Implemented proper cleanup with nested pool relationships (effects contain particles)
   - Added specialized reset functions to handle different particle types
   - Pre-allocated pools based on typical usage patterns
   - Added VFX-specific pool statistics functions

4. **Debug Features**:
   - Added pool statistics overlay (accessed with `` ` `` + `p` in debug mode)
   - Created pool usage tracking with reuse percentage calculations
   - Added console logging for key pool operations
   - Implemented test script for validating pool behavior

## Design Decisions

1. **Multiple Pool Types**: We decided to use separate pools for different object types (tokens, VFX particles, VFX effects) rather than a single pool with type information. This provides better type safety and simplifies reset functions.

2. **Reset Strategy**: Each pool has a custom reset function that meticulously clears all object properties to prevent "spooky action at a distance" bugs from lingering references.

3. **Debug Integration**: The pool system integrates with the existing debug overlay system, making it easy to monitor pool performance during gameplay.

4. **Factory Functions**: Each pool uses a factory function to customize object creation, allowing specialized initialization for different object types.

## Debug Instructions

To monitor pool usage:
1. Press `` ` `` to activate debug mode
2. Press `p` to show pool statistics overlay
3. Watch object counts, active/available ratios, and reuse percentages

## Testing 

A comprehensive test script at `tools/test_pools.lua` validates:
- Basic pool operations (create, acquire, release)
- Pool growth under high demand
- Token usage simulation with realistic patterns
- VFX particle simulation with bursts of effects

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Garbage Collection**: By reusing objects instead of creating and discarding them, we've reduced GC pressure significantly.

2. **Smoother Gameplay**: Frame spikes from large object allocations are eliminated, providing more consistent frame times.

3. **Memory Efficiency**: Object pooling keeps memory usage more predictable and avoids fragmentation over time.

4. **Enhanced Debugging**: The pool statistics tools make it easy to identify potential memory leaks or inefficient object usage.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Automatic Shrinking**: Pools could automatically shrink when demand decreases for extended periods.

2. **Time-Based Stats**: Add timing information to track peak allocation rates.

3. **Object Validation**: Add runtime checks to ensure objects are properly reset before reuse.
