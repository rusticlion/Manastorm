~Define & Migrate Cast Time/Defense/Zone Keywords (Behavior Only)

Goal: Define keywords for remaining mechanics: cast time, defense, zone 
effects.
Tasks:
Identify logic for delay, accelerate, dispel, disjoint, freeze, echo, 
block, reflect, zoneAnchor, zoneMulti.
Define corresponding keyword entries in keywords.lua.
Populate the behavior table for each.
Deliverable: keywords.lua includes definitions for these remaining 
keywords with populated behavior tables.~
